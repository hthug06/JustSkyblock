Plugin skyblock (create by me)
actualy in developpement but you can try it anyways
this minecraft plugin need 2 others plugins, you can download them in the "dependances" folder

Have fun ^^

Actualy implement:
- island (/IS)
- setspawn on island
- delete the island
- visit other player island
- island level
- island team
- quest
- admin command (/ISA)

working on:
- custom generator 

to add:
- better admin panel
- implement basic thing when the plugin start for the first Time (like more island schematic)
- made the plugin 100% custom (like custom quest, generator, custom permission,...)
- personnal World border system (I currently use this : https://github.com/yannicklamprecht/WorldBorderAPI )
- personnal island copy / paste from a schematic (currently using World edit)
- no other plugin dependances at all 

add me on discord if you want to suggest me other things (ds : ht06)
